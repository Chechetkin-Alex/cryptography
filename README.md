# Cryptography
In this project I implemented several types of encryption and decryption, wrote some testes (main modules  are fully covered), came up with a communication system with user.

### How to run this project?
```shell
python3 main.py
```

If you want to **run tests**, use
```shell
./run_tests.sh
```

If something went wrong, install modeles from `requirements.txt`
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Enjoy!**

This project is made for educational purposes.
